title: About Me
---

My name is Zach Gagnon, and I am fifth year graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm from a town called Port Jefferson Station on the north shore of Long Island. Here at RIT I am in my last semester of the applied statistics MS program, and I am a member of the men Lacrosse team. After RIT, I will be starting a job as an actuarial analyst at Corebridge Financial, formerly AIG Life & Retirement. Outside of my education and playing lacrosse, I enjoy playing golf, watching movies, and spending quality time with my family and friends. I am also a big sports fan. I am life long New York Mets and New York Jets fan. For those familiar, my 23 years of fandom have been nothing but agonizing, but I am hoping for a brighter future for both teams.
